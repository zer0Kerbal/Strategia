    desc = Our standard training procedure is to treat newly hired astronauts as a disposable commodity to greatly reduce the cost of unscheduled disassemblies.  Still, some argue that training our astronauts before putting them on top of a top of a ton of explosives will result in a lower mission failure rate.  The cost of setting up the program will be high, nevermind the cost of actually training the astronauts.  What do you say, do we want the right stuff, or the almost-good-enough stuff?
