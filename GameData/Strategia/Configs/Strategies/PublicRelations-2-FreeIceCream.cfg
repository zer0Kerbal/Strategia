    title = Free Ice Cream

    desc = We've come up with a crazy idea - giving out free ice cream at the space center.  The public will absolutely love us.  If we push the program far enough, we'll get better rewards for rescuing Kerbals (they'll get ice cream when they land!) and maybe even be able to get a discount on hiring new astronauts.  FREE.  ICE.  CREAM.
